I noticed the fixed fee proposal (10,999 €) is higher than the pricing shown on your website. Could you help me understand what additional value or features are included in this package?\n\nAlso, if we were to give you the green light today, would you be open to discussing a potential discount on the package?\n\nBest regards\n```\n\nThis response is professional and direct, addressing both of your points:\n1. It politely questions the pricing difference between the website and the proposal\n2. It opens the door for a potential discount negotiation while showing serious interest with the \"green light today\" proposition\n\nWould you like me to modify this response in any way before you send it?",

Here's what makes them special:\n\n**Basic Dictionary Operations:**\n```python\n# Creating a dictionary\nstudent = {\n    'name': 'Alice',\n    'age': 22,\n    'major': 'Computer Science'\n}\n\n# Accessing values\nprint(student['name'])  # Alice\nprint(student.get('grade', 'Not found'))  # Safe access\n\n# Adding/updating values\nstudent['grade'] = 'A'\nstudent['age'] = 23\n```\n\n**When to use dictionaries vs lists:**\n- Use dictionaries when you need to look up values by a meaningful key\n- Use lists when order matters and you access items by position\n- Dictionaries are faster for lookups (O(1) vs O(n) for lists)\n\nWould you like me to show you some more advanced dictionary techniques?",
